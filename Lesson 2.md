# Lesson 2: Basics of Data Types and Variable Declaration

## Declare Variables
In JavaScript, to name a variable you have to type "var" first, then put the name of the variable you want. You can further assign value to the variable with "=" sign.<br/>
For example, name a variable MyVar with value 5 should look like:<br/>
`var MyVar = 5`<br/>
`var MyName = "EnChiSu"`<br/>
**Note:** <br/>
Every command line should follow with a semicolon `;`.

## Data Types
There are also various data types, which are "undefined", "null", "boolean", "string", "symbol", "bigint, "number", and "object". <br/>
**Note:** <br/>
1. In JavaScript, you can concatenate strings with `+`. For example, <br/>
`var MyVar = "I am a "` <br/>
`MyVar = MyVar + "String!"` <br/>
The new MyVar would be "I am a String!".*

2. Capitalization matters <br/>
For example, `MYVAR` is not the same as `MyVar` nor `myvar`. <br/>
There is one naming convention called "camelCase", which means the multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized. (變數的第一個字母小寫，接續的變數名中，如果有英文字詞則該字詞的第一個字母大寫) For example, <br/>
`var someVariable;`<br/>
`var anotherVariableName;`<br/>
`var thisVariableNameIsSoLong;`<br/>
