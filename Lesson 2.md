# Lesson 2 Notes

## Declare Variables
In JavaScript, to name a variable you have to type "var" first, then put the name of the variable you want. You can further assign value to the variable with "=" sign.<br/>
For example, name a variable MyVar with value 5 should look like:`MyVar = 5`<br/>

## Data Types
There are also various data types, which are "undefined", "null", "boolean", "string", "symbol", "bigint, "number", and "object". <br/>
Note: In JavaScript, you can concatenate strings with `+`. For example, <br/>
`var MyVar = "I am a "
MyVar = MyVar + "String!"`
The new MyVar would be "I am a String!".
