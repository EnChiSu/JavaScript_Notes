# Lesson 3: Basics of variables manipulation

1. Add one to a variable
`i++;` is the equivalent of `i = i + 1;`<br/>

2. Decrease a variable by one
`i--;` is the equivalent of `i = i - 1;`<br/>

3. Remainder operator is `%`
For example, `17 % 3 = 2`.

4. Operator `+=` 
`+=` equals to add value to variable itself. For example,
`myVar += 5;` equals to `myVar = myVar + 5;`
